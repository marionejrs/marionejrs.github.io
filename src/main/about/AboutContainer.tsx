                I’m a full-stack developer based in Manila, Philippines.
                I’m driven to learn and expand my skills in development.
                I’m previously from a Java and Python development background
                for almost four years but shifted to full-stack development in
                the middle of 2018. I also have experience in mobile development.
                I love to travel to various countries including Korea and Japan.
                I eventually want to travel to Europe and South America. Memes and
                Japanese culture gives me life.
